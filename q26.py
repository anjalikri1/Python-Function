# Q26. Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.
# 1.
# 2.
# 3.
# 4.
# If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
# If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
# If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
# Otherwise, it should return the same number.


# def fizz_buzz(a):
#     if a%3==0 and a%5==0:
#         op="fizzbuzz"
#     elif a%3==0:
#         op="fizz"
#     elif a%5==0:
#         op="buzz"
#     print(op)
# fizz_buzz(27)

# Q27. Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one
# parameter: speed.
# 1. If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
# 2. Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one
# demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is
# 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
# 3. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”


# def check(speed):
#     if speed<=70:
#         print("OK")
#     elif speed>70:
#         a=speed-70
#         c=0
#         i=0
#         while i<=a:
#             c+=1
#             i+=1
#         b=c//5
#         print(b,"point")
#         if b>12:
#             print("license suspend")

# a=int(input("enter the speed "))
# check(a)
